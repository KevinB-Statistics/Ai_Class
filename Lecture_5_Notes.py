# Lecture_5 Wednesday Sept 3rd & Lecture_6 Friday Sept 5th Notes
'''
Data/input/features -> model -> output

We have a limited sets of outputs
The relationship/logic between input and output is hard-coded/deterministic

Input features are highly engineered

Hard coded rules -> sort of analogous to an expert system

Understand:
* Model parameters and hyperparameters
* Model capacity
* Data driven decisions (machine learning)
* Model Error


Model hyperparameters: things we give model at the start of the process that it cannot change while it's training

Model parameters: Characteristics of the model that it will change while training
