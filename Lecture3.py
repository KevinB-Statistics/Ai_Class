Machine learning - subset of AI, typically involves data-intensive techniques

Datasets
For supervised ,machine learning, generally use a dataset with:
Input data - Data you give to the model
Output data - Results of interest that you want a model to be able to generate

Wine quality dataset 
Each column is a feature of the data
Each row is an indivdiual wine

Input data are called features
Output data are called outcomes

Two types of machine learning:
Supervised - has both feature and outcome in training set; model uses outcome data to evaluate the model
Unsupervised - only have feature data for the model;

Training set
Test set
Validation set (mini-test during model training)

Evaluating the model:
How well it did:
*Accuracy
*Optimal fitness function

How much the model sucked:
*Error function/loss function/cost function

Lots of potential error function
*MSE
*Mean average error
*Root mean squared error
*Cross entropy loss
