Neural Network:

Neuron receives input and goes through a transformation process with internal parameters and gives output

Multi layered perceptron
Neurons are base unit
Neurons are arranged in layers

How do inputs and outputs work?
In a fully connected neural network, each layer gets input from the layer before it, and outputs to the next layer
The first layer gets input from your actual data
The last layer output is the overall network output 

Important information - 
It's called a feed forward network, because the information goes forward layer by layer until you get an output
